## Built With

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Bootstrap

## Current Features

- To start, user clicks a button on a modal box.
- The user is presented with a question and three possible answers.
- Upon making a selection, the user is presented with a result message.
- The message will either say "correct" and increment the score, or it will say "wrong" and show the correct answer.
- Next, the user can click a button to be presented another question.
- There are ten questions to cycle through. Upon completion, the user will be able to click a button to see the final results.

## Wish List

In the future I hope to develop further functionality including:

- Add time-based scoring
- Track scores across games (even if the page is reloaded)
- Allow users to compete against each other on a high-score board.
